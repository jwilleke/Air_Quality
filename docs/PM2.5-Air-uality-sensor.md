# PM2.5 sensor with an I2C interface

A PM2.5 sensor with an I2C interface allows for measuring particulate matter (PM) concentration in the air, specifically particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and communicates data via the I2C protocol.

This interface makes it compatible with various microcontrollers and single-board computers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi

We used the [DFRobot Gravity sensor](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity_PM2.5_Air_Quality_Sensor_SKU_SEN0460)
